# Better Learn

Companion extension for Up Learn.

## Features

- **Complete assignment:** checks off all non-video activities in a subsection.
- **Skip video:** skips the content of the current video and only displays questions.
- **Video speed:** adjust video speed past normal limits.  
  *Past 3.5x speed questions will not be triggered so video lessons will not be checked off.*
